# react-redux-toolkit

This project is a simple counter application built with React and Redux Toolkit (RTK).  
It serves as a step-by-step guide for learning the core concepts of Redux Toolkit in a practical way.

## Features

- Create Redux store with `configureStore`  
- Connect React app to Redux using `Provider`  
- Define state and reducers using `createSlice`  
- Use `useSelector` and `useDispatch` hooks to read and update state  
- Handle async actions with `createAsyncThunk`  
- Manage async states: loading, fulfilled, and rejected

```
## Next Steps
To further improve this project, consider exploring:

- API integration with RTK Query
- Performance optimization using selectors
- Managing normalized data with Entity Adapter
- Writing and using custom middleware
- Advanced TypeScript typings in Redux
